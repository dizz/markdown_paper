# Your next Paper should be in Markdown!

1. Put the style files from the CFP in *template/*
1. All you diagrams go in *img/*
1. Edit the *header.tex* and *footer.tex*
1. Make sure MultiMarkdown is in your path.

And now write your paper in Markdown - then run: *./deploy.sh {pdf,html}*

Note: if you multiple files you can edit the *deploy.sh* file.
